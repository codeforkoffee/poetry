jin [1:55 PM] 
Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

jin [2:13 PM] 
Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells

# Caged Bird

### Verse 1

The free bird leaps
on the back of the wind
and floats downstream
till the current ends
and dips his wings
in the orange sun rays
and dares to claim the sky.

### Verse 2

But a bird that stalks
down his narrow cage
can seldom see through
his bars of rage
his wings are clipped and
his feet are tied
so he opens his throat to sing.

### Verse 3

The caged bird sings
with fearful trill
of the things unknown
but longed for still
and his tune is heard
on the distant hill
for the caged bird
sings of freedom
